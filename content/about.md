About
=========================

This site is dedicated to discussions about one of history's best comedy television series, Seinfeld.

It is the final project for the course ramverk1 at BTH. It is meant to mimic the functionality of a Reddit-like site.

It has been developed by ([Emil Sandberg](mailto:emil.hietanen@gmail.com)), a second year student at the BTH program for Web programming.

The source code for the site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/emsa16/ramverk1-project).
